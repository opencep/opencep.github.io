A promise is a method that eventually produces a value. Instead of passing a function as argument as with callbacks, “Once
the result is received from an asynchronous operation then the required function is executed”. The required functions are
never passed as arguments to the asynchronous operation. It has the form:

<script>
callAsyncFunction()
    .then(firstFunction)
    .then(secondFunction)
    .then(thirdFunction)
    .then(fourthFunction);

</script> Same thing using callbacks

<script>
callAsyncFunction(function (err, result) {
    firstFunction(err1, result, function (result2) {
        secondFunction(err2, result2, function (result3) {
            thirdFunction(err3, result3, function (result4) {
                fourthFunction(err4, result4){
                    //Final code here 
                });
            });
        });
    });
});
</script> P.S. This pyramid like code structure depicts a Callback Hell. It can make debugging very difficult in large projects.
